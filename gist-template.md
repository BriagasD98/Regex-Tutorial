# Regex Tutorial

What is **Regex**? Is it a dinosaur? Is it slang for rejects? In the world of programming, **Regex** is short for **Regular Expressions**. **Regex** are incredibly
useful for isolating information from bodies of text by search patterns. This tool is extremely versatile in that it can be used in almost
all programming languages. In this **gist**, we'll be analyzing an example of **Regex** in detail hoping to give users a better idea of
what it is and how to use it.

## Summary
```
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```
The code snippet above is an example of **Regex** that will be analyzed and explained in the following sections. This **Regex** is used to define
a sequence of characters that matches the pattern of an email address. A basic email address consists of 4 key properties:

- String of characters and/or digits and/or dots, hyphens and/or underscores
- The at sign (@)
- The domain name which can be a string of characters and/or digits
- The domain extension preceeded by a dot (.)
